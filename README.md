# A Conversation through TikToks

[Live Project](https://isabelstoddart.github.io/tiktokclock/)

This prokect is a representation of TikToks that were recorded between me and my friend from January 28th to February 10th. This projest has two parts, a hand drawn visualization and a web based visualization.

## Hand Drawn Visualization
This visualization shows a week of Tik Toks represented in a clock like fashion. The lines on the "clocks" represent each hour of the day (1 through 12).There are two "clocks", one showing TikToks received by me and one showing TikToks received by my friend. Each mark on the clock represents 1 TikTok. The color of the marks indicates the theme of the TikTok, the symbol on the marks represents the receiver's reactions, and the direction of the mark represents if it was sent in the AM or the PM.

This visualization shows each TikTok using a clock to represent the time each TikTok was sent. The rim of the clock changes color depending on the sender. The background represents time moving from AM to PM. The hands of the clock change color depending on the content of the TikTok and the middle of the clock changes shape depending on the text reaction of the receiver.
